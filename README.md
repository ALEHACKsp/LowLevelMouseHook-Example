Somewhat barebones example showing you how to remove LLMHF_INJECTED/LLKHF_INJECTED and LLMHF_LOWER_IL_INJECTED/LLKHF_LOWER_IL_INJECTED from mouse/keyboard inputs
created/done by functions such as SendInput/MouseEvent/KeybdEvent

The code should be fairly stable and and ready to run.
Plenty of stuff could be improved, but I wont bother as I mainly created this repository to give people a basic understanding 
how they would go about to strip LLMHF_INJECTED/LLKHF_INJECTED and LLMHF_LOWER_IL_INJECTED/LLKHF_LOWER_IL_INJECTED.

Feel free to contribute if you want!
